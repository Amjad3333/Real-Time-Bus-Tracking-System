# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking-System
What the project does
It is possible to track a bus in real time, and this information can subsequently be sent to a distant 
user that wishes to know real-time bus information. Our system delivers relevant information 
regarding:
Real-time location: The bus's current location will be presented here.
Route details: The system will show the route details along with the names of the stations.
Driver's Contact Number: The system will show the driver's name along with his or her contact 
information.
Why the project is useful
The proposed work's main purpose is to improve the Bus system by incorporating necessary extra 
features into the application, such as accurate bus timetables, exact bus numbers, and a GPS 
tracker.
This App accepts input in the form of selection of the bus, to track the location of the respective 
bus and give the map for the same. It can also show the expected time required for the bus to reach 
the user.
To give the user the exact location of the selected bus with respect to the user location.
The proposed work's main goal is to enhance the Bus Tracking system by including 
important features into our project, such as projecting accurate bus times, providing correct 
bus numbers, and tracking the driver/allocated person for bus location accuracy. The app 
can be downloaded to the designated person's or institution's smartphone. We may expand 
the initiative's scope to include the typical citizen, who will be able to download the app 
to their phones. His or her relatives, as well as the police, will be able to track their location 
once it has been taken. It can also be used to track buses for private tour operators.
